It's always been tough to get out of deepression when you have bad time. When you think nobody on the earth wants you, everthing seems worthless. It feels like all the hydrogen fuel inside you had been burned just a neutron or a black hole remained.

The Worst part, Depression will take you to the darkest and give you a hug while saying "This is where you belong.".
